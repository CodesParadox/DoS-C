## Purpose
This code implements a scripts for conducting a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on a network target specified by host and port. The type of the attack is specified as an argument to the script: "udp", "pps", or "sock".

The start_sock function opens a stream socket and continuously attempts to connect to the target host and port for a specified number of seconds. The start_pps and start_udp functions similarly send random data to the target using either Datagram or Datagram sockets, respectively.

The check_target_status function attempts to connect to the target host and port, and returns a boolean indicating whether the target is online.

The Public class is a wrapper for these functions, with threads specifying the number of threads to use when launching the attack. If the attack type is "sock", the main method of the Public class first verifies that the target is online and then launches the attack, reporting the online status of the target both before and after the attack.

## Installation & Usage
#### For The Basic Version - DoS_C.py
```
git clone https://github.com/CodesParadox/DoS-C
cd ./DoS_C
```
You should run as root:
```
python / python3 <filename>.py <method> <ip> <port> <time>
```
#### For The Advance Version - DosRunner.py
```
python3 DosRunner.py --mode [mode] --host [host] --port [port] --secs [secs] --threads [threads] --connections [connections]
```



## Important Notes
1. The scripts are beta version and still under development. 
2. The scripts are not intended to be used for malicious purposes, illegal purposes, or any other purposes that are operate amy forbidden activity by law.
3. The DOC_C.py script is a basic version of the DoS attack, and the DosRunner.py script is an advanced version of the DoS attack, which is more powerful and has more features, that is in progress.
4. Single-threaded attacks are not recommended, as they are very slow and can be easily detected by the target.
5. Note that this README will be updated as the project progresses. 



**For one person this attack is Dos and not DDos, but for many people it is DDos.
The goal of this project is to create a tool that can be used to perform a DoS attack on a network target specified by host and port and to create a tool that can be used to perform a DDos attack on a network target specified by host and port with different methods.
This tool is for educational purpose to know how to perform a DoS attack with different methods and features that make the code to be more powerful and more effective.
Im start to working on IP Adress spoofing and MAC Adress spoofing to make the attack more powerful and undetectable, by making the code polymorphic and obfuscated.**

At the end after all the scripts are ready, the goal is to add this script to undercover file (that is malicious) to create a backdoor for the attacker to control the victim's computer and to tell him "Congratulations, you are a soldier in the Botnet Army" XD

## Approach
A few notes about the DDoS approach:

### Limitations

### Advantages
 - When it comes to Windows, the generated payloads can run even in PowerShell constraint Language Mode.
 - The generated payloads can run even by users with limited privileges.

## Contributions
Pull requests are generally welcome. 
There are parts of this project that were removed before publishing because I considered them to be buggy or hard to maintain (at this early stage).
If you have an idea for an addition that comes with a significant chunk of code, I suggest you first contact me to discuss if there's something similar already in the making, before making a PR.
